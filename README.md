# Advanced-Game-Character
Took the Game-Character code and added functionality.

The character program implements an application that prompts the user for various information needed to fill out every mv (member variable) of the class. There are four string mv's and 6 integer mv's. It validates that the characterClass matches the list. It validates that the character name is under 20 characters. Validates gender is male or female, and that the race is elf, human, or dwarf. Capitilization can be ignored. Validates that all integer mv's are indeed integers. It then neatly displays all the information given to the prompts next to its corresponding attribute. Below that, it shows the total of all the integer attributes added together.
